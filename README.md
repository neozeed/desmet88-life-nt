# desmet88-life-nt

This is my old 'update' of the Desmet-C life demo to use the Windows NT 
cusor API directly bypassing the need for sgetty/termios/curses.

While not a comprehsnsive port, its enough to see how to manipualte the screen.

I've been able to get this to run on the Windows NT 1991 previews.
